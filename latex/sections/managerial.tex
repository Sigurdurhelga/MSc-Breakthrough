\begin{dedications}
  I dedicate this thesis to my family, who while not understanding most of what I do,
  always support me and the friends that still want to talk to me even though my
  schedule has rendered me unmeetupwithable. Lastly, my girlfriend Hulda, who always helps me get 
  through the tough times, and makes the good times even better.

I would first like to thank my supervisor, Yngvi Bj√∂rnsson, his knowledge in this field is vast and he is always ready to share invaluable wisdom when it's needed. Your critical feedback and consistent positivity has pushed me and my work to a higher level.

Secondly, I would like to thank my colleagues, who provided stimulating conversations on the topic and a helpful eye from a different perspective every time I needed it.
