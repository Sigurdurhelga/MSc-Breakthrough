%%%%%%% CHOOSE ONE OF THESE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% projectreport: Project report (CS)
%% bachelors: Bachelor of Science thesis
%% masters: Master of Science thesis
%% doctorate: Doctor of Philosophy dissertation
%
%%%%%%% CHOOSE ONE OF THESE %%%%%%
%%
%% draft: speed up processing by skipping graphics and adding useful
%%     information for editing.  Also sets spacing to double so that it is easier to
%%     write editing marks on paper copy.
%% proof:  proofreading version (final formatting with warnings)
%% final: generate document for submission, removing FIXMEs, and
%%     other markup.  Throw error if any fatal FIXMEs still in document.
%%
%%%%%%% CHOOSE ONE OF THESE IF APPLICABLE %%%%%%
%%
%% deptsse: School of Science and Engineering
%% deptscs: School of Computer Science
%%
%%%%%%%% CHOOSE ANY COMBINATION OF THESE %%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% forcegraphics: force graphics, etc. to be included, even in draft mode
%% debug:  writes more messages to the log file, adds debugging output
%%     and sizing boxes
%% icelandic: thesis is in Icelandic
%% oldstyle:  use the PhD headers and footers from the old CS template
%% online: for online versions (skip blank pages)
\documentclass[online,masters,deptscs,forcegraphics,draft]{ruthesis}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TeXStudio Magic Comments %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% These comments that start with "!TeX" modify the way TeXStudio works
%% For details see http://texstudio.sourceforge.neit/manual/current/usermanual_en.html   Section 4.10
%%
%% What encoding is the file in?
% !TeX encoding = UTF-8
%% What language should it be spellchecked?
% !TeX spellcheck = en_US
%% What program should I compile this document with?
% !TeX program = xelatex

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Bibliography options %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% We suggest switching from bibtex to biblatex/biber because it is better able
%% to deal with Icelandic characters and other bibliography issues
%% As long as you use biblatex instead of bibtex by itself, it will at least
%%  generate a document without errors.
%% !!!If you are using TeXStudio, don't forget to update the bibliography setting!!!
\usepackage[backend=bibtex,bibencoding=utf8,style=ieee]{biblatex}
%\DeclareLanguageMapping{american}{american-apa}
% need to declare mapping for style=apa to alphabetize properly
% If you set backend=bibtex, it will use bibtex for processing (old way)
%    this can work with Icelandic characters, but you may get weird results.
%    bibtex does not know how to sort Þ and ð
% if you set backend=biber, you can use UTF8 characters such as Þ and
%     ð  but you will have to remember to switch from using bibtex to
%
%     biber in your client
% If you use JabRef, make sure the file is encoded in UTF-8 which is
%    not the default.

%% This tells TeXStudio to use biber
% !TeX TXS-program:bibliography = txs:///biber
%% This also sets the bibliography program for TeXShop and TeXWorks
% !BIB program = biber

% Where is your reference library?
\addbibresource{references.bib}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CUSTOMIZATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% It is not recommended that you customize this file nor
%% ruthesis.cls.  Just fill in the necessary fields.  You should put
%% your macros and packages into a separate file so that it is easier
%% to use updates to the template.  The custom.sty file was created
%% for this reason.  We load this much later so that it can overrite
%% any existing settings
\IfFileExists{custom.sty}{\usepackage{custom}}{}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INFORMATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
%% University information must be multilingual to deal with the
%%  required cover pages and abstract on thesis
%% NOTE: This may not be required for other reports!!!

%% Babel Icelandic macros are setup  on RedHat at

%% These two for the internal cover pages, usually not needed
%\newML{TitleInternal}{Internal Title}{Icelandic Internal Title}

%% Author name (should be the same in any language, if not use \newML)
%% If you are writing a Project report with multiple authors, separate them with \\:
%% To keep the names typeset together, you want to use non-breaking spaces: ~
%\author{Firstname1~Lastname1\\Firstname2~Lastname2}
\author{Sigurður Helgason}

%% If the name must be formatted specifically for the signature page

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%INDEX SETUP %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Indexes, and other auto-generated material
%% The Memoir package (which we use) automatically generates the index
%% See section 17.2 on page 302 of the guide
%% http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/latex/memoir/memman.pdf
%% This means you have to run "makeindex DEGREE-NAME-YEAR"
%% !!!Do not load any of the index packages, they cause problems with Memoir!!!
%% !!!You have been warned!!!
%% Note that memoir changes the [] options to only be for filenames, not other options!
\makeindex{}
\indexintoc{}

%% For abbreviations, you may want to try
%% Watch out though, each new index writes another external file and
%% latex can only write a limited number of them
%%\usepackage[intoc]{nomencl} % intoc: In Table of Contents
%% remember to run:
%% makeindex filename.nlo  -s nomencl.ist -o filename.nls

\finalifforcegraphics{hyperref} %hyperlinks even in draft mode
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}
%% !!!Must be the last package loaded except otherwise mentioned!!!!
%% \usepackage{hypcap}  %% puts link at top of figure, must be after hyperref
