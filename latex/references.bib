  abstract = {{"}... Here we introduce an alg. based solely on
		 reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or
		 domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its
		 own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict
		 AlphaGo's own move selections \& also the winner of
		 AlphaGo's games. This NN improves the strength of the
		 tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection
		 \& stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting
		 tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved
		 superhuman performance, winning 100--0 against the
		 previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.{"} --

  abstract = {{"}We describe AlphaFold, the protein structure
		 prediction system that was entered by the group A7D in
		 CASP13. Submissions were made by three free-modeling
		 (FM) methods which combine the predictions of three
		 neural networks. All three systems were guided by
		 predictions of distances between pairs of residues
		 produced by a NN. Two systems assembled fragments
		 produced by a generative NN, one using scores from a
		 n/wk trained to regress GDT\_TS. The third system shows
		 that simple gradient descent on a properly constructed
		 potential is able to perform on par with more expensive
		 traditional search techniques \& without requiring
		 domain segmentation. In the CASP13 FM assessors'
		 ranking by summed z-scores, this system scored highest
		 with 68.3 vs 48.2 for the next closest group (an
		 average GDT\_TS of 61.4). The system produced
		 high-accuracy structures (with GDT\_TS scores of 70 or
		 higher) for 11 out of 43 FM domains. Despite not
		 explicitly using template information, the results in
		 the template category were comparable to the best
		 performing template-based methods.{"} [36 refs.] --
