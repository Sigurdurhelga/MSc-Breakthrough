  abstract =	"{"}... Here we introduce an alg. based solely on
		 reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or
		 domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its
		 own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict
		 AlphaGo's own move selections \& also the winner of
		 AlphaGo's games. This NN improves the strength of the
		 tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection
		 \& stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting
		 tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved
		 superhuman performance, winning 100--0 against the
		 previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.{"} --
